Detecting corrosions and defects from photos of ship vessels. 

The pipeline can be decomposed into 4 steps:
1. Super Resolution. \
	Upsample low-res images to high-res images for more detailed analysis of different parts of ships.
2. Segmentation. \
	2.1 Ship parts segmentations. \
	2.2 Corrosion & defect areas segmentation.
3. Classification.
4. Final Evaluation.
